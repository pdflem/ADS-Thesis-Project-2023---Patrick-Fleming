# Project Title: Unveiling Test Response Patterns: Cluster Analysis of University Students' Career Aptitude Assessments for AI-Enabled Coaching
by Patrick Fleming

Applied Data Science Masters thesis for the University of Utrecht 2023

This project is a cluster analysis of Utrecht University students'answers to career apititude tests in an effort to develop generalized profiles that can be used to assist in the optimization of an AI career coach. The AI coach can use the generalized profiles to better provide recommendations to students. For example, if a particular cluster is found to have a strong inclination towards STEM fields, the AI coach can suggest STEM-related career paths to users who exhibit similar interests or characteristics. 


The code in this repository act as the preprocessing, methods, and results steps in the project.
